# Current Plan & Priorities 🎯

## **🚨 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Fix GitHub Actions CI Failure**

### **Current Issue:**
- GitHub Actions CI failing with exit code 1
- Root cause: `comprehensive_test_suite.py` exceeded size guard limits (80 KB, 1,200 lines)
- **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Test suite refactoring completed, fixing import issues

### **✅ Completed:**
1. **Test Suite Refactoring**: Split large file into modular structure
2. **New Infrastructure**: Created `test_infrastructure.py` with common utilities
3. **Size Reduction**: Reduced from 42,932 bytes/1,267 lines to 349 lines
4. **Modular Design**: Implemented clean, maintainable test architecture

### **🔄 Current Work:**
1. **Import Path Issues**: Resolving `ModuleNotFoundError` in refactored test suite
2. **Test Execution**: Ensuring refactored test suite runs successfully
3. **CI Validation**: Verifying all tests pass and CI workflow succeeds

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Complete Import Fixes**: Resolve remaining module import issues
2. **Test Suite Validation**: Run comprehensive test suite successfully
3. **CI Workflow Test**: Ensure GitHub Actions will pass
4. **Branch Merge**: Create PR and merge to main
5. **Phase 5**: Begin next development phase

- **Deployment Test Suite**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** - 100% endpoint success rate
- **Local CI Tests**: ✅ **PASSING** - All Ruff, Black, and syntax tests passing
- **GitHub Actions CI**: ❌ **FAILED** - Exit code 1, needs investigation
- **Real Data Access**: ✅ **CONFIRMED** - 268 files, 66 MB accessible
- **Code Quality**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** - All local CI workflow tests passing

### **🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR NEXT SESSION:**
1. **CI Workflow Investigation**: Identify specific cause of GitHub Actions failure
2. **Issue Resolution**: Fix any remaining problems found by CI workflow
3. **CI Success**: All GitHub Actions workflows pass successfully
4. **Branch Merge**: Feature/reorganized-codebase can be merged to main

### **📋 NEXT SESSION TASK LIST:**
1. **Investigate CI Failure**:
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error
   - Identify what caused the workflow to fail
   - Determine if it's a code issue or workflow configuration issue

2. **Fix Remaining Issues**:
   - Address any problems found in CI logs
   - Ensure all code quality standards are met
   - Test fixes locally before re-running CI

3. **Verify CI Success**:
   - Re-run GitHub Actions workflow
   - Confirm all checks pass
   - Ensure branch is ready for merge

4. **Prepare for Merge**:
   - Create merge request
   - Merge feature/reorganized-codebase to main
   - Begin Phase 5 development planning

### **🚀 LONG-TERM GOALS:**
