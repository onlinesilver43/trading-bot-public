- [x] Create GitHub repo (onlinesilver43/trading-bot) + CI/CD (GitHub Actions → SCP)
- [x] Switch to binanceus; inject API keys via GH Secrets → droplet .env
- [x] Clean up repository and fix all linting issues
- [x] Deploy and test current bot system
- [x] Upgrade droplet to Basic plan (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 232GB storage)

## **NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION: Self-Funding Unlimited Scaling**

### **CURRENT GOAL**: Build self-funding, unlimited scaling trading system
- **Target**: $1K → $50K+ in 1 year through multi-bot, multi-coin trading
- **Strategy**: Get profitable from day 1, self-fund development
- **Timeline**: 1-week sprint to complete system, 4 weeks to self-funding

### **Self-Funding Development Strategy**
1. **Week 1**: Generate $200+ profit to fund development
2. **Week 2**: Use profits to build full multi-bot system  
3. **Week 3**: Complete AI agent, achieve self-funding
4. **Week 4+**: Unlimited scaling begins

### **Multi-Bot Architecture**
- **Bot 1**: Core Strategy Bot (enhanced current bot) - 30% capital ($300)
- **Bot 2**: Scalping Bot (high-frequency) - 25% capital ($250)
- **Bot 3**: Momentum Bot (trend following) - 25% capital ($250)
- **Bot 4**: Arbitrage Bot (cross-exchange) - 15% capital ($150)
- **Bot 5**: Hedging Bot (risk management) - 5% capital ($50)

### **AI Agent Integration**
- **Market Analysis**: Real-time condition monitoring
- **Strategy Selection**: Dynamic strategy switching
- **Bot Orchestration**: Coordinate all 5 bots simultaneously
- **Risk Management**: Portfolio-level risk control

## **ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE & UI STRATEGY**

### **Why Enhanced Infrastructure First**
- **Safety**: Protect $1K capital during aggressive development
- **Reliability**: Quick rollback capability if issues arise
- **Testing**: Validate each component before going live
- **Confidence**: Robust infrastructure enables unlimited scaling

### **Enhanced Deployment & Testing Framework**
- **GitHub Actions**: Enhanced workflows with testing and rollback
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system monitoring
- **Rollback System**: Quick recovery from any issues
- **Testing Framework**: Validate each component before deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance in real-time

### **UI Architecture Decision: Integrated Approach**
**Keep UI integrated with main system** rather than separating:

#### **Benefits of Integrated UI**:
✅ **Single deployment**: One system to manage and monitor  
✅ **Real-time data**: Direct access to bot state and performance  
✅ **Unified monitoring**: Everything visible in one dashboard  
✅ **Easier maintenance**: One codebase, one deployment pipeline  
✅ **Better performance**: No API calls between separate services  

#### **Current UI Structure** (already working):
```
FastAPI App (current UI)
├── Bot Status (/api/state)
├── Exports (/exports)
├── Source Downloads (/api/source.zip)
└── Build Meta (/api/meta)
```

#### **Enhanced UI Structure** (to be built):
```
FastAPI App (enhanced UI)
├── Bot Status (all 5 bots)
├── Strategy Performance (real-time metrics)
├── History Fetcher (data inventory, download status)
├── Risk Management (portfolio monitoring)
├── Deployment Management (version control, rollback)
├── Performance Analytics (charts, metrics, comparisons)
└── System Health (resource usage, API status)
```

### **UI Integration for All New Capabilities**
Every new feature will be visible in the UI:
- **History Fetcher Status**: Download progress, data inventory, storage usage
- **Multi-Bot Dashboard**: Status of all 5 bots, performance metrics
- **Strategy Performance**: Real-time strategy comparison and switching
- **Risk Management**: Portfolio risk levels, position monitoring
- **Deployment Status**: Current version, rollback options, deployment history

## **REVISED DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE (1 Week Sprint)**

### **Days 1-2: Enhanced Infrastructure & UI**
- **Day 1**: Build robust deployment/rollback system
- **Day 2**: Create comprehensive testing framework and enhanced UI dashboard

### **Days 3-4: History Fetcher & Data Foundation**
- **Day 3**: Build history fetcher with UI monitoring
- **Day 4**: Download and process 5+ years of historical data

### **Days 5-6: Enhanced Bot & Multi-Coin Support**
- **Day 5**: Enhance current bot with multi-coin support
- **Day 6**: Test enhanced bot and validate strategies

### **Day 7: System Validation & Live Trading Readiness**
- **Day 7**: Full system testing, paper trading validation, ready for live trading

## **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Build enhanced infrastructure (deployment, rollback, testing)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Build history fetcher and enhanced bot with UI integration
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Generate $200+ profit in first week
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Use profits to build full multi-bot system
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Complete AI agent and achieve self-funding
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Begin unlimited scaling ($2K → $50K+)

## **ORIGINAL PLANNED FEATURES (To be integrated)**
- [ ] Add second bot: ETH/USD, TIMEFRAME=5m (own service)
- [ ] UI: show current pair/timeframe + multi-bot status (BTC & ETH)
- [ ] Optional: domain + reverse proxy later

## **Success Metrics**
- **Enhanced Infrastructure**: Robust deployment, rollback, and testing capabilities
- **UI Integration**: All new capabilities visible in unified dashboard
- **Immediate Profitability**: $200+ profit in first week
- **Self-Funding**: System pays for its own development
- **Unlimited Scaling**: $1K → $50K+ in 1 year
- **Risk Management**: Never exceed 10% daily loss
- **Performance**: 200%+ annual returns consistently

*This plan will be updated as we progress through implementation and discover new requirements. The goal is to build robust infrastructure first, then achieve profitability from day 1 and self-fund the entire development process.*
