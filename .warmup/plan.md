# Trading Bots – Strategic Plan

## **COMPLETED MILESTONES**
- [x] Create DO droplet (Ubuntu 25.04) and connect from WSL (sshpass alias: tb)
- [x] Install Docker + Compose; create /srv/trading-bots; add swap
- [x] Build paper SMA bot + FastAPI UI; run via Compose
- [x] Create GitHub repo (onlinesilver43/trading-bot) + CI/CD (GitHub Actions → SCP)
- [x] Switch to binanceus; inject API keys via GH Secrets → droplet .env
- [x] Clean up repository and fix all linting issues
- [x] Deploy and test current bot system

## **NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION: Self-Funding Unlimited Scaling**

### **CURRENT GOAL**: Build self-funding, unlimited scaling trading system
- **Target**: $1K → $50K+ in 1 year through multi-bot, multi-coin trading
- **Strategy**: Get profitable from day 1, self-fund development
- **Timeline**: 1-week sprint to complete system, 4 weeks to self-funding

### **Self-Funding Development Strategy**
1. **Week 1**: Generate $200+ profit to fund development
2. **Week 2**: Use profits to build full multi-bot system  
3. **Week 3**: Complete AI agent, achieve self-funding
4. **Week 4+**: Unlimited scaling begins

### **Multi-Bot Architecture**
- **Bot 1**: Core Strategy Bot (enhanced current bot) - 30% capital ($300)
- **Bot 2**: Scalping Bot (high-frequency) - 25% capital ($250)
- **Bot 3**: Momentum Bot (trend following) - 25% capital ($250)
- **Bot 4**: Arbitrage Bot (cross-exchange) - 15% capital ($150)
- **Bot 5**: Hedging Bot (risk management) - 5% capital ($50)

### **AI Agent Integration**
- **Market Analysis**: Real-time condition monitoring
- **Strategy Selection**: Dynamic strategy switching
- **Bot Orchestration**: Coordinate all 5 bots simultaneously
- **Risk Management**: Portfolio-level risk control

## **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Build history fetcher and enhanced current bot
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Generate $200+ profit in first week
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Use profits to build full multi-bot system
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Complete AI agent and achieve self-funding
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Begin unlimited scaling ($2K → $50K+)

## **ORIGINAL PLANNED FEATURES (To be integrated)**
- [ ] Add second bot: ETH/USD, TIMEFRAME=5m (own service)
- [ ] UI: show current pair/timeframe + multi-bot status (BTC & ETH)
- [ ] Optional: domain + reverse proxy later

## **Success Metrics**
- **Immediate Profitability**: $200+ profit in first week
- **Self-Funding**: System pays for its own development
- **Unlimited Scaling**: $1K → $50K+ in 1 year
- **Risk Management**: Never exceed 10% daily loss
- **Performance**: 200%+ annual returns consistently

*This plan will be updated as we progress through implementation and discover new requirements. The goal is to get profitable from day 1 and self-fund the entire development process.*
