python3 market_analysis/test_regime_detection.py  # Already tested and working

# ❌ WRONG - No need to fix import issues (already resolved)
# All import issues have been fixed and tested

# ❌ WRONG - No need to reorganize codebase (already done)
# Codebase is properly organized and ready for deployment
```

../.venv/bin/python3 testing/comprehensive_test_suite.py  # Should show 100% success rate

# ✅ CORRECT - Test deployment locally
python3 main.py  # Test bot entry point
python3 -m uvicorn ui.ui:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080  # Test UI entry point

# ✅ CORRECT - Create feature branch and deploy
git checkout -b feature/reorganized-codebase
git add .
git commit -m "Reorganize codebase with proper directory structure"
```
